I’m your all-around developer. I dabble in frontend, backend and hardware hacking. I've loved tech ever since I can remember and on any given day you can usually find me working on one of my nerdy side projects. ;-)

I’m currently working as a Software Engineer in San Francisco, CA.

I hope you find my articles useful, and if you have any questions or just want to chat feel free to drop me a line. I'd love to hear what you're working on or any cool ideas you may have!
